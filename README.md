# S.imple S.mart C.lock

A simple code project around the question:
How to make the simplest clock as possible?!

## How this work

This experimental project work with the internal arduino clock. Stop use rtc clock, there is a clock in arduino!

## Explanations

The Arduino's problem is the lot of leds around the microcontroller, so i created a pcb to exploit the Atmega328 without inutile and intensives consumption parts. The pcb is designed specialy for a specific alarm-clock, but, you can modify it as your wish! This is the magic of open-source
